# Module: Visitors

The visitors module can be used to show the visitors of the previous hour on your site on a map. It can also be used to show other items on the same map that are linked to other modules.

## Installation

Visit the [Fork CMS knowledge base](http://fork-cms.com/knowledge-base) to learn how to install a module. To download the zip-package go to the [extension page](http://www.fork-cms.com/extensions/detail/visitors) of the module on fork-cms.com.

## Usage

To couple the module to google analytics, you'll need a client id and a client secret. You can obtain it by following these steps

* Visit [googles api console](https://code.google.com/apis/console)
* Log in with the google account coupled to your analytics profile
* Go to 'Services' and make sure the Analytics API is enabled
* Go to API access. Create a new client ID
* For redirect URI, choose your SITE_URL follewed by '/private/nl/visitors/settings'

Coupling your analytics profile will only work locally when you use an accessible address (think of [xip io](http://xip.io/))

## Contributing

It would be great if you could help us improve the module. GitHub does a great job in managing collaboration by providing different tools, the only thing you need is a [GitHub](https://github.com/) login.

* Use **Pull requests** to add or update code
